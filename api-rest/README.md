# API REST
This is the API REST for the LuxuryStay hotel chain. It is a RESTful API that allows you to manage the reservations of the hotel.

## What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is a lightweight, stateless, and cacheable protocol that uses HTTP methods to interact with resources. REST is designed to be simple and easy to understand, and it is widely used in modern web applications.

## How it works?
REST uses HTTP methods to interact with resources. The most common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each method has a specific purpose:

- GET: Retrieves a representation of a resource.
- POST: Creates a new resource.
- PUT: Updates an existing resource.
- DELETE: Deletes a resource.
