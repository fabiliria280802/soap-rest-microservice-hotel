# Microservice
This is the microservice for the LuxuryStay hotel chain. It is a microservice that allows you to manage the inventory of the hotel.

## What is a microservice?
A microservice is a small, independent service that performs a specific function. Microservices are designed to be small, simple, and focused on a single task. They are often built using lightweight frameworks and can be deployed independently. Microservices are designed to be scalable, resilient, and easy to maintain.

## How it works?
Microservices architecture involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent services that each handle specific functions. These services communicate with each other through lightweight APIs, allowing for greater scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enabling continuous integration and delivery. This modular approach allows teams to work on different components simultaneously, improving development speed and efficiency.
